# KaynakSenin-Vue-Django-Project


### About Project
KaynakSenin is a full stack student project. It uses vue for frontend and django for backend. It's in Turkish so it can be hard to understand what this website is about. We can summurize the project as its a website to rank university exam prep books and rank yourself in tests scores which uploaded by other people. KaynakSenin totally works with no problem (Well, it works on my computer as usual) but due to some financial and time problems its not functioning right now. I spent a lot of times on this project. I learned too many things about web development, testing, debugging and sort of things. It was a great experience for me to improve myself. I'm not uploading license so if you notice a bug or want to ask me something you can find my email adress on my profile. 

### Requirements
You can find front-end requirements in front-end/package.json, dependicies. For backend; python, django and django rest framework is required.
